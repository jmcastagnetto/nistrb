Description: This package allows programmatic access to the NIST Randomness
    Beacon, through its REST web service interface.
    The service returns an XML document with several pieces of information:
    \itemize {
        \item The (seed) value represented as a 64 byte (512-bit) hex string value, and its timestamp
        \item The SHA-512 hash value for the previous record as a 64 byte hex string
        \item A digital signature (RSA) computed over (in order): version, frequency, timeStamp, seedValue, previousHashValue, errorCode. Note: Except for version, the hash is on the byte representations and not the string representations of the data values
        \item The SHA-512 hash of the signature as a 64 byte hex string
        \item The service version and its update frequency
        \item The status of the response
    }
